# Guava BBQ Sauce

**Cuisine:** Guyanese-West Coast  

**Prep Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 6  
**Dietary Restrictions:** gluten-free, vegetarian-friendly  

## Ingredients  

- 1 cup guava paste or guava jelly  
- 1/2 cup ketchup  
- 1/4 cup maple syrup (for a Canadian touch)  
- 1 tbsp tamarind sauce  
- 2 tbsp lime juice  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 1 tsp grated ginger  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1/4 tsp ground allspice  

## Instructions  

1. In a medium saucepan, combine guava paste, ketchup, and maple syrup. Heat on low-medium, stirring until the guava paste dissolves into a smooth mixture.  
2. Add tamarind sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, grated ginger, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and ground allspice. Stir well to combine.  
3. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.  
4. Taste and adjust the flavors as needed (e.g., add more lime juice for tanginess or a pinch of smoked paprika for additional smokiness).  
5. Remove from heat and allow the sauce to cool.  
6. Store in a clean jar or container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.  

Enjoy as a glaze for grilled meats, tofu, or roasted vegetables, or use as a dipping sauce!
