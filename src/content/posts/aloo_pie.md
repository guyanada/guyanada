# Aloo Pie

**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 20 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan  

## Ingredients

- 4 medium-sized potatoes  
- 2 cups all-purpose flour  
- 1 medium onion, finely diced  
- 1 teaspoon of your favorite spices (e.g., cumin, turmeric, or garam masala)  
- Cooking oil for frying  

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Potatoes:**  
   Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into smaller chunks for quicker cooking. Place them in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, which should take about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and mash them thoroughly with a fork or potato masher until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.  

2. **Sauté the Onions:**  
   Heat a small pan over medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil. Once the oil is warm, add the diced onions and sauté until they turn translucent and slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent burning.  

3. **Mix the Filling:**  
   Combine the mashed potatoes, sautéed onions, and your chosen spices in a mixing bowl. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed throughout the potato mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.  

4. **Prepare the Dough:**  
   In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt (optional) and gradually add water while mixing. Knead the mixture until it forms a smooth and elastic dough. This process should take about 5-7 minutes. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes.  

5. **Assemble the Pies:**  
   Divide the dough into small portions, roughly the size of a golf ball. Roll out each portion into a circle about 6 inches in diameter on a lightly floured surface. Place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center of the dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling to form a semi-circle and press the edges firmly to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for extra security and a decorative touch.  

6. **Fry the Pies:**  
   Heat enough oil in a deep frying pan to fully submerge the pies. The oil should be hot but not smoking (approximately 350°F/175°C). Carefully lower each pie into the oil and fry until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pies and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.  

7. **Serve:**  
   Let the aloo pies cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy them on their own or with your favorite dipping sauce, such as tamarind or mango chutney.
