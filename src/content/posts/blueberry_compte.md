# **Recipe: Blueberry Sage Compote**

This bold and flavorful compote combines the sweetness of blueberries, the earthiness of sage, and the fruity heat of wiri wiri peppers for a spicy twist. Perfect for adventurous palates!

## **Ingredients**
- 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
- 1/4 cup brown sugar (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup (optional for extra sweetness)
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
- 4-5 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
- Optional: 1-2 wiri wiri peppers, finely chopped (adjust for heat tolerance)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water (optional for thickening)

## **Instructions**

### Using Frozen Blueberries:
- If using frozen blueberries, there's no need to thaw them beforehand. Add them directly to the saucepan, but note that they may release more liquid during cooking. To achieve the desired consistency, you may need to:
  - Simmer for a slightly longer time to reduce the liquid.
  - Use the cornstarch slurry to thicken the compote if necessary.

1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**
   - Wash fresh blueberries if using, and finely chop the sage leaves and wiri wiri peppers.

2. **Cook the Compote:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the blueberries (fresh or frozen), brown sugar, maple syrup (if using), balsamic vinegar, ginger, and chopped wiri wiri peppers over medium heat.
   - Cook for 7-10 minutes (frozen blueberries may take slightly longer), stirring occasionally, until the blueberries soften and release their juices.

3. **Add Sage and Lime Juice:**
   - Stir in the chopped sage and lime juice, allowing the flavors to meld. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

4. **Thicken (Optional):**
   - If a thicker consistency is desired, add the cornstarch slurry and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the compote thickens.

5. **Cool and Serve:**
   - Remove the compote from heat and let it cool slightly before serving.



## **Serving Suggestions**
- **With Meat:** Pair with grilled or roasted pork, duck, or venison for a spicy, fruity glaze.
- **For Breakfast:** Add as a topping for savory pancakes or cornbread.
- **As a Sauce:** Serve over cream cheese with crackers for a spicy-sweet appetizer.

## **Tips for Frozen Blueberries**
- Frozen blueberries can release more liquid during cooking, so monitor the consistency and adjust cooking time as needed.
- The flavors will be just as vibrant as with fresh blueberries, but the compote may have a slightly smoother texture due to the breakdown of frozen berries.
- If the compote appears too watery, simmer uncovered for an extra few minutes or add the cornstarch slurry.

This **Blueberry Sage Compote with Wiri Wiri Peppers** is a bold fusion of sweet, herbal, and spicy elements that pairs beautifully with both savory and sweet dishes.
