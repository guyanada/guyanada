**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 45 minutes  
**Servings:** 6  
**Dietary Restrictions:** None

## Ingredients

- 2½ lbs chicken, cut into pieces
- 3 tbsp green seasoning
- 1 tsp crushed ginger
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 1½ tsp vegetable oil
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 small onion, sliced
- ½ green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- ½ red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 7 sprigs thyme
- Water, to cover meat
- 1 lb Yukon gold potatoes, cut into wedges
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 2 chicken bouillon cubes
- 2 scallions, chopped

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken**
   - In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with green seasoning, crushed ginger, salt, black pepper, and ketchup. Mix thoroughly to ensure each piece is well coated.
   - Cover and let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for enhanced flavor.

2. **Caramelize the Sugar**
   - In a heavy-bottomed pot large enough to hold the chicken, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
   - Add the brown sugar and allow it to melt and caramelize, stirring occasionally. The sugar will melt and turn a dark brown (be careful not to let it burn, as this will impart a bitter taste).

3. **Brown the Chicken**
   - Once the sugar has reached a rich dark brown color, carefully add the marinated chicken pieces to the pot. Stir to coat the chicken evenly with the caramelized sugar.
   - Allow the chicken to cook for about 15 minutes without stirring to develop a deep brown color.

4. **Add Aromatics and Tomato Paste**
   - Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes to integrate the flavors.
   - Add the sliced onion, red and green bell peppers, and thyme. Cook for an additional 5 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.

5. **Simmer the Stew**
   - Pour in enough water to barely cover the chicken. Add the potato wedges, soy sauce, and chicken bouillon cubes. Stir to combine.
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and let it simmer for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the sauce has reduced and thickened to your liking.

6. **Finish and Serve**
   - Remove the pot from heat and stir in the chopped scallions.
   - Serve the brown stewed chicken warm over rice, with sides such as rice and peas, boiled and fried provisions, or macaroni and cheese.

## Notes

- **Caramelizing Sugar:** This traditional method imparts a deep color and rich flavor to the stew. Monitor the sugar closely to prevent burning.
- **Marinating:** Allowing the chicken to marinate enhances the depth of flavor in the final dish.
- **Serving Suggestions:** Pair this dish with classic Caribbean sides like rice and peas, boiled and fried provisions, or macaroni and cheese for a complete meal.
