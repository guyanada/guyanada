# Bust Up Shut Roti (Paratha Roti)

**Prep Time:** 40 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 20 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Cuisine:** Guyanese  

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
- 1 tablespoon oil or melted butter (for the dough)  
- 1 cup water (adjust as needed)  
- 4 tablespoons ghee or butter (for brushing and cooking)  
- Additional flour for dusting  

## Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Dough**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix well.
   - Gradually add water while mixing to form a soft dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
   - Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

### 2. **Divide and Roll**
   - Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and shape them into smooth balls.
   - Roll each ball into a thin circle, approximately 8-10 inches in diameter, on a lightly floured surface.

### 3. **Brush and Fold**
   - Lightly brush the surface of each rolled-out dough with melted ghee or butter.
   - Make a small slit from the center to the edge and roll the dough into a cone shape. Then, flatten the cone slightly and fold it into a ball.
   - Repeat for all the dough portions and let them rest for another 10 minutes.

### 4. **Cook the Roti**
   - Heat a tawa, cast-iron skillet, or non-stick frying pan over medium heat.
   - Roll out each dough ball into a thin circle again.
   - Place the rolled-out dough on the hot pan and cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles form. Flip and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes.
   - While cooking, brush the roti with ghee or butter on each side to enhance flavor and help it puff up.

### 5. **Bust It Up**
   - Remove the cooked roti from the pan and immediately clap it between your hands (use a clean kitchen towel if it's too hot) or use two spatulas to scrunch and tear it into flaky pieces. This creates the signature "bust up shut" look.
   - Repeat with the remaining dough.

### 6. **Serve**
   - Serve warm with your favorite curries, stews, or chutneys. Popular pairings include curry chicken, dhal, or pumpkin curry.

Enjoy the flaky, buttery goodness of this traditional Guyanese roti!
