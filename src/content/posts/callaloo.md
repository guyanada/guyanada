## **Ingredients**

- 1 lb callaloo leaves (or substitute with spinach or amaranth leaves if unavailable)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt (or to taste)

- 1/4 cup water (as needed)

## **Instructions**

### 1. Prepare the Callaloo Leaves:
1. Wash the callaloo leaves thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or grit.
2. Remove the tough stems and chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.

### 2. Sauté the Aromatics:
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the onions and garlic. Sauté until fragrant and the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.
3. Add the chopped tomato and cook for another 2-3 minutes until softened.

### 3. Cook the Callaloo:
1. Stir in the chopped callaloo leaves and diced okra (if using).
2. Add the turmeric powder, black pepper, and salt.
3. Pour in the coconut milk and a splash of water (if needed to prevent sticking). Mix well.

### 4. Simmer:
1. Cover the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Allow the callaloo to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the leaves are tender and cooked through.
2. For a spicier dish, place the whole scotch bonnet pepper on top of the callaloo during the simmering process. Remove it before serving.

### 5. Adjust and Serve:
1. Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
2. Serve hot as a side dish with rice, roti, or bread. It also pairs well with fish or stewed meats.
