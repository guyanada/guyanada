# **Crispy Cassava Fries**

Cassava fries are a delicious and crispy alternative to potato fries, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavor. They are a popular snack or side dish in Guyanese cuisine.

## **Ingredients**

- 2 lbs cassava (yuca), peeled and cut into sticks
- Water (for boiling)
- 1 tsp salt (for boiling)
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil (or vegetable oil)
- Oil for frying (if deep-frying)

## **Instructions**

### 1. Prepare the Cassava:
1. Peel the cassava and cut it into fry-sized sticks (about 3-4 inches long and 1/2 inch thick).
2. Remove the fibrous core in the center of the cassava (if visible).

### 2. Boil the Cassava:
1. Place the cassava sticks in a large pot and cover with water.
2. Add 1 tsp of salt to the water and bring it to a boil.
3. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the cassava is tender but not falling apart. Test with a fork to ensure it is soft enough to eat but still holds its shape.
4. Drain and allow the cassava to cool slightly.

### 3. Season the Cassava:
1. In a large bowl, toss the boiled cassava sticks with garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed.

### 4. Fry the Cassava:
- **For Deep-Frying:**
  1. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350°F (175°C).
  2. Fry the cassava sticks in small batches until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes.
  3. Remove and drain on paper towels.

- **For Baking:**
  1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
  2. Place the seasoned cassava sticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
  3. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.

- **For Air-Frying:**
  1. Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).
  2. Arrange the cassava sticks in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
  3. Cook for 15-18 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through, until crispy and golden.

### 5. Serve:
1. Transfer the cassava fries to a serving platter.
2. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt if desired.
3. Serve hot with dipping sauces like tamarind chutney, lime pepper sauce, or ketchup.

## **Tips:**
- For extra crispiness, ensure the cassava sticks are completely dry before frying.
- Experiment with spices like cayenne pepper or cumin for added flavor.
- Cassava fries taste best when freshly made but can be reheated in an oven or air fryer for crispiness.
