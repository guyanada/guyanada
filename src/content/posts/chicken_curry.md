## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**  
   Start by washing the chicken pieces and patting them dry. If desired, season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper. Peel and dice the potatoes into uniform pieces for even cooking. Chop the onions, garlic, and ginger if using.

2. **Brown the Chicken:**  
   Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in batches, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the chicken and set it aside.

3. **Build the Base:**  
   Lower the heat to medium and add the chopped onions, garlic, and ginger (if using) to the same pot. Saut√© for 2-3 minutes until softened and fragrant. Stir in the curry powders, cooking for about 1 minute to toast the spices and release their aroma.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**  
   Return the browned chicken to the pot, tossing it to coat in the curry mixture. Add the diced potatoes, ensuring they are well mixed. Add enough chicken stock to just cover everything . 

5. **Simmer the Curry:**  
   Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the curry cook for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chicken should be fully cooked, tender, and infused with the curry flavors, while the potatoes and should be soft but not falling apart.

6. **Adjust Seasoning:**  
   Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. If you prefer more heat, add a finely chopped Scotch bonnet or chili pepper at this stage.  If the curry is still to run, then use a fork to smash the potatoes against the side of the pot

7. **Serve and Garnish:**  
   Ladle the curry into bowls and garnish . Serve hot with steamed rice, roti, or even bannock to soak up the flavorful sauce.
