## Ingredients

### Noodles
- 12 oz (340g) chow mein noodles or thin spaghetti
- Water for boiling
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

### Protein (Optional)
- 1 lb (450g) chicken breast or tofu, cut into thin strips
- 1 tbsp cassareep or browning sauce
- 2 tbsp green seasoning
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Vegetables
- 1 cup bora (Chinese long beans) or green beans, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 cup carrots, julienned
- 1 cup cabbage, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 stalks bok choy, chopped
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp freshly grated ginger
- 2 scallions, chopped

### Sauce
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce (use vegetarian oyster sauce for vegan)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance flavors)

### Garnish
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Noodles
1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 tsp salt and the chow mein noodles.
2. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Be cautious not to overcook, as they will cook further during stir-frying.
3. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water to halt the cooking process.
4. Toss the noodles with 1 tbsp vegetable oil to prevent sticking and set aside.

### 2. Marinate the Protein (if using)
1. In a bowl, combine the protein strips with cassareep or browning sauce, green seasoning, soy sauce, salt, and pepper.
2. Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating. Allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight for enhanced flavor.

### 3. Cook the Protein
1. Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the marinated protein and stir-fry until fully cooked and lightly browned, approximately 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove the protein from the wok and set aside.

### 4. Stir-Fry the Vegetables
1. In the same wok, add another 1 tbsp of vegetable oil if necessary.
2. Saut√© the sliced onion until translucent, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger; stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4. Incorporate the carrots, bora or green beans, cabbage, bell pepper, and bok choy. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

### 5. Combine Noodles, Protein, and Sauce
1. Return the cooked protein to the wok with the vegetables.
2. Add the cooked noodles to the mixture.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, Chinese five-spice powder, black pepper, and sugar (if using).
4. Pour the sauce over the noodle mixture and toss gently to ensure all components are evenly coated.
5. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

### 6. Serve
1. Transfer the chow mein to a serving platter.
2. Garnish with chopped scallions and fresh cilantro.
3. Serve hot, accompanied by lime wedges for an added zest.

## Notes
- **Vegetarian/Vegan Adaptation:** Substitute the protein with tofu or additional vegetables. Use vegetarian oyster sauce to maintain a vegan profile.
- **Noodle Selection:** Authentic Guyanese chow mein is best achieved with specific chow mein noodles, but thin spaghetti can serve as a substitute if unavailable.
- **Flavor Enhancements:** The inclusion of Chinese five-spice powder and bora beans imparts a distinctive Guyanese flair to the dish. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
