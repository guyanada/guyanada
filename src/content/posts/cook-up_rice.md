**Prep Time:** 15 minutes (plus soaking time for peas)  
**Cook Time:** 60 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan  

## Ingredients

- 2 cups long-grain white rice (such as basmati or jasmine)  
- 1 cup dried pigeon peas (or 1 can pigeon peas, drained and rinsed)  
- 1 cup coconut milk  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)  
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth (adjust as needed)  
- 1 whole Scotch bonnet or wiri wiri pepper (optional, for heat)  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for sautéing)  
- Optional garnish: chopped scallions or fresh herbs  

## Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Pigeon Peas**

- **For Dried Pigeon Peas:**  
  - Place the dried pigeon peas in a bowl and cover them with water. Allow them to soak overnight or for at least 8 hours to soften.  
  - After soaking, drain and rinse the peas thoroughly.  
  - Transfer the soaked peas to a pot, cover with fresh water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook for about 30 minutes, or until the peas are tender but not mushy. Drain and set aside.  

- **For Canned Pigeon Peas:**  
  - Simply drain and rinse the peas under cold water to remove any excess brine. Set aside.  

### 2. **Rinse the Rice**

- Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and helps achieve fluffy, separate grains. Set the rinsed rice aside to drain.  

### 3. **Sauté the Aromatics**

- In a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.  
- Add the finely chopped onion and sauté for about 3 minutes, until it becomes translucent and fragrant.  
- Stir in the minced garlic and thyme leaves, and continue to sauté for an additional minute, being careful not to let the garlic burn.  

### 4. **Combine Ingredients**

- Add the cooked (or canned) pigeon peas to the pot, stirring to combine them with the sautéed aromatics.  
- Pour in the coconut milk and water or vegetable broth, stirring well to incorporate.  
- Season the mixture with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  
- If using, add the whole Scotch bonnet or wiri wiri pepper to the pot for a subtle heat infusion. Be careful not to burst the pepper unless you prefer a spicier dish.  

### 5. **Cook the Rice**

- Bring the liquid to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.  
- Once boiling, add the rinsed and drained rice to the pot, stirring to ensure the rice is evenly distributed.  
- Allow the mixture to return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.  
- Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let it simmer gently for about 20–25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. Avoid lifting the lid during this time to ensure proper steam cooking.  

### 6. **Rest and Fluff**

- Once the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed, remove the pot from the heat.  
- Let it sit, covered, for an additional 5–10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to firm up slightly.  
- After resting, remove the whole pepper if used, and discard.  
- Gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.  

### 7. **Serve**

- Transfer the Cook-Up Rice to a serving platter or individual plates.  
- Garnish with chopped scallions or fresh herbs if desired.  
- Serve hot as a hearty main course or as a side dish accompanying other Guyanese specialties.
