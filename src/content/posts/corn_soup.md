## Ingredients

- 4 ears of fresh corn, husked and cut into 2-3 inch pieces
- 1 cup yellow split peas, soaked for 4 hours or overnight
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 6 cups vegetable stock or water
- 1 tablespoon green seasoning (Guyanese herb blend)
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 whole Scotch bonnet or wiri wiri pepper (optional)
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Optional Dumplings

- ¾ cup all-purpose flour (use gluten-free flour if needed)
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon butter or margarine (use vegan butter for vegan option)
- ¼ cup whole milk or plant-based milk

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Yellow Split Peas

1. Drain and rinse the soaked split peas.
2. In a large pot, combine the split peas with 4 cups of vegetable stock or water.
3. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the peas begin to soften.

### 2. Sauté the Aromatics

1. In a skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion, garlic, scallions, and thyme. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until fragrant and slightly softened.

### 3. Build the Soup Base

1. Transfer the sautéed aromatics to the pot with the split peas. Stir to combine.
2. Add the diced potatoes, carrot, and corn pieces to the pot.
3. Stir in the green seasoning, turmeric, and cumin.

### 4. Simmer the Soup

1. Pour in the remaining 2 cups of vegetable stock and the coconut milk. Stir well to combine.
2. Add the whole Scotch bonnet or wiri wiri pepper for a mild heat (do not burst the pepper unless you prefer more spice).
3. Simmer the soup over medium heat for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender and the corn is fully cooked.

### 5. Prepare the Dumplings (Optional)

1. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper.
2. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Add the milk and knead to form a stiff dough.
4. Break the dough into small pieces and drop them into the simmering soup.
5. Cook the dumplings for 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface and are cooked through.

### 6. Adjust Seasoning and Serve

1. Remove the whole pepper from the pot.
2. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper as needed.
3. For a thicker consistency, use a potato masher or immersion blender to partially mash the soup, leaving the corn pieces whole.
4. Serve the soup hot, ensuring each bowl contains pieces of corn on the cob and dumplings if added.

## Notes

- **Variations:** Feel free to add other vegetables such as cassava, eddoes, or spinach to enhance the soup's heartiness.
- **Spice Level:** Adjust the heat by adding or omitting the Scotch bonnet or wiri wiri pepper.
- **Storage:** Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat gently, adding a splash of water if the soup has thickened.

This fusion of Guyanese and Trinidadian corn soup brings together the rich flavors of the Caribbean, offering a comforting and nourishing dish perfect for any occasion.
