## Notes  

- **Curry Powder:** Use a Guyanese-style curry powder for authenticity or a West Indian blend for a similar flavor.  
- **Spinach Substitution:** Kale or Swiss chard can be used instead of spinach for added texture.  
- **Seafood Variations:** Substitute with other local seafood like clams, shrimp, or even Pacific halibut for variety.  
- **Serving Suggestion:** Serve with a side of steamed jasmine rice or roti to soak up the flavorful lentils.  

Enjoy this enhanced fusion of Guyanese flavors and West Coast Canadian seafood, now with the added goodness of spinach for a nutritious and vibrant dish!
