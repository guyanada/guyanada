## Ingredients

- **For the Chicken:**
  - 2 chicken breasts (approximately 1 pound)
  - 1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder
  - 1 tablespoon green seasoning (a blend of fresh herbs and aromatics)
  - 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce (sambal oelek)
  - 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
  - 1/2 tablespoon light soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free option)
  - 1/2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
  - 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
  - 1 teaspoon tomato paste
  - 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
  - Dash of ground cinnamon

- **For the Tacos:**
  - 8 gluten-free taco shells or soft tortillas
  - 1 ripe avocado, diced
  - 1 cup fresh salsa
  - 1 cup shredded lettuce or cabbage
  - Lime wedges, for garnish

## Instructions

#### 1. **Prepare the Marinade**
   - In a medium bowl, combine the Chinese five-spice powder, green seasoning, chili garlic sauce, dark brown sugar, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, tomato paste, grated ginger, salt, black pepper, and a dash of ground cinnamon. Mix thoroughly to form a smooth marinade.

#### 2. **Marinate the Chicken**
   - Rinse the chicken breasts under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
   - Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag.
   - Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated. Massage the marinade into the meat for even distribution.
   - Cover the dish with plastic wrap or seal the bag, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat. For a more intense flavor, marinate overnight.

#### 3. **Grill the Chicken**
   - Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (approximately 375째F or 190째C).
   - Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Discard the remaining marinade.
   - Place the chicken breasts on the preheated grill.
   - Grill each side for about 6-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (75째C) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center.
   - Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.

#### 4. **Prepare the Taco Fillings**
   - While the chicken is resting, dice the avocado and prepare the fresh salsa.
   - Warm the taco shells or tortillas according to the package instructions.
   - Optional: Lightly grill the taco shells for added flavor and texture.

### 5. **Assemble the Tacos**
   - Slice the rested chicken breasts into thin strips.
   - In each taco shell, layer the shredded lettuce or cabbage, sliced chicken, diced avocado, and a spoonful of salsa.
   - Squeeze fresh lime juice over the fillings for added zest.

### 6. **Serve**
   - Arrange the assembled tacos on a serving platter.
   - Garnish with additional lime wedges and fresh cilantro, if desired.
   - Serve immediately while the chicken is warm and the taco shells are crisp.
