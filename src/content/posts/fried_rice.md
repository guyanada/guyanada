## Instructions  

### 1. Prepare the Rice  
- If not using day-old rice, cook the rice and spread it out on a tray to cool. Cold rice is ideal for fried rice because it prevents clumping and sogginess.  

---

### 2. Marinate the Protein (if using)  
1. For chicken or shrimp: Toss with a splash of soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Let it sit for 10 minutes.  
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook the protein until fully cooked. Remove and set aside.  

---

### 3. Sauté Aromatics  
1. Heat another tablespoon of oil in the same skillet or wok.  
2. Add the chopped onion, garlic, and grated ginger. Sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  

---

### 4. Cook the Vegetables  
1. Add the carrots, peas, and bell peppers to the skillet. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until tender-crisp.  
2. Stir in the scallions and mix well.  

---

### 5. Combine the Sauce  
1. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, cassareep (if using), and black pepper.  
2. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and stir to coat.  

---

### 6. Add the Rice and Protein  
1. Increase the heat to high and add the cooked rice to the skillet.  
2. Toss everything together, ensuring the rice is evenly coated with the sauce.  
3. Return the cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu to the skillet, if using, and stir to combine.  
4. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat through and develop flavors.  

---

### 7. Serve  
1. Transfer the fried rice to a serving platter.  
2. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley, and serve with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes on the side.

## Notes  
- **Vegetarian/Vegan Option:** Use tofu or additional vegetables instead of chicken or shrimp. Replace oyster sauce with vegetarian mushroom sauce.  
- **Authentic Flavor:** Cassareep adds a smoky and slightly sweet depth of flavor, traditional to Guyanese cuisine. If unavailable, omit or substitute with a splash of soy sauce and a pinch of brown sugar.  
- **Customizable Vegetables:** Add cabbage, green beans, or corn for more variety.  

Enjoy this vibrant and flavorful Guyanese Fried Rice, a beloved dish perfect for any meal or celebration!
