**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Dietary Restrictions:** None  

## Ingredients  

- 1 pound BC spot prawns (substitute with shrimp if spot prawns are unavailable)  
- 1/2 cup ginger beer  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil  
- 2 cups cooked coconut rice (for serving)  

## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Prawns or Shrimp**  
   - Rinse the spot prawns (or shrimp) under cold water to remove any debris.  
   - If desired, peel them while leaving the tails intact for presentation, or leave them fully shelled. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.  

### 2. **Heat the Skillet**  
   - Place a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add the cooking oil. Allow the oil to heat up for about 1-2 minutes until it shimmers but does not smoke.  

### 3. **Sauté the Garlic**  
   - Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and sauté for 30 seconds to 1 minute, stirring constantly. The garlic should become fragrant and slightly golden but not burned.  

### 4. **Cook the Prawns or Shrimp**  
   - Add the spot prawns or shrimp to the skillet in a single layer. Cook them for about 2-3 minutes on one side until they turn pink and start to curl.  
   - Flip using tongs or a spatula and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side until fully pink and opaque.  

### 5. **Glaze with Ginger Beer**  
   - Reduce the heat to low and pour the ginger beer over the prawns or shrimp. Stir gently to coat them evenly.  
   - Let the ginger beer simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces and thickens into a sticky glaze.  

### 6. **Serve**  
   - Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the glazed prawns or shrimp to a serving plate.  
   - Serve immediately over a bed of warm coconut rice, spooning any remaining ginger beer glaze from the pan over the seafood for added flavor.  

### 7. **Optional Garnish**  
   - Garnish with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, or a sprinkle of green onions for added color and flavor.  

Enjoy the delightful combination of sweet, tangy ginger beer glaze and tender BC spot prawns or shrimp over creamy coconut rice!
