**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Fermentation Time:** 3–5 days  
**Yield:** Approximately 1 gallon  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan, Gluten-Free  

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh ginger root
- 12 cups room temperature water
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tablespoon whole cloves
- 6 inches dried orange peel (divided into two pieces)
- 1 cup demerara sugar (or turbinado sugar)
- 1/4 cup white rice (optional, to aid fermentation)

## Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Ginger**

- **Peeling (Optional):** Some recipes suggest peeling the ginger to avoid any potential bitterness from the skin. Use a spoon to scrape off the skin if desired.
- **Grating:** Grate the ginger using a fine grater or food processor to maximize flavor extraction.

### 2. **Combine Ingredients**

- **Mixing:** In a large sterilized glass bottle or mason jar, combine the grated ginger, water, cinnamon sticks, cloves, dried orange peel, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and rice (if using). Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.

### 3. **Fermentation**

- **Covering:** Cover the container with a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth to allow airflow while preventing contaminants from entering.
- **Setting:** Let the mixture sit at room temperature for at least three days. Traditionally, the mixture is placed in the sun daily to aid fermentation, but keeping it on the kitchen counter works as well.
- **Stirring:** Stir the mixture once daily to promote even fermentation.

### 4. **Straining and Sweetening**

- **Straining:** After the fermentation period, strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean container to remove the solids.
- **Sweetening:** Add the remaining sugar to the strained liquid, adjusting to taste. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.

### 5. **Bottling and Storage**

- **Bottling:** Transfer the ginger beer into sterilized bottles or jars with tight-fitting lids.
- **Refrigeration:** Store the ginger beer in the refrigerator, where it can last for up to one month. Refrigeration halts the fermentation process.

## Tips for the Best Ginger Beer

- **Fermentation Duration:** The longer the ginger beer ferments, the stronger its flavor becomes. For a more robust taste, allow it to ferment for 4–5 days.
- **Equipment Sterilization:** Ensure all equipment, especially bottles or jars, are thoroughly cleaned and sterilized to prevent unwanted bacteria from affecting the fermentation process.
- **Flavor Variations:** You can experiment with different sweeteners like brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup, keeping in mind they may impart distinct flavors. Adding pineapple juice or lime juice after fermentation can enhance sweetness and complexity.

## Serving Suggestions

- **Chilled:** Serve the ginger beer chilled or over ice for a refreshing beverage.
- **Garnish:** Enhance presentation and flavor by adding dried orange slices or pieces of sugar cane to the drink.
