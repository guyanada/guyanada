**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Yield:** Approximately 2 cups  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan, Gluten-Free  

## Ingredients  

- 1 bunch cilantro  
- 1 bunch parsley  
- 6 scallions (green onions)  
- 1 medium onion, chopped  
- 6 cloves garlic  
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)  
- 2 wiri wiri peppers (or 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, adjust to taste)  
- 1 small bell pepper (optional, for added flavor and bulk)  
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lime juice  
- 1/4 cup water (adjust for consistency)  
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  

## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Ingredients**  
   - Wash all the fresh herbs (cilantro, parsley, and scallions) thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.  
   - Roughly chop the herbs, onion, and bell pepper to make blending easier.  
   - If using wiri wiri or Scotch bonnet peppers, remove the seeds for a milder flavor, or leave them in for more heat. Handle the peppers carefully to avoid skin or eye irritation.  

### 2. **Blend the Ingredients**  
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the cilantro, parsley, scallions, onion, garlic, thyme, peppers, and bell pepper.  
   - Add the white vinegar (or lime juice), water, vegetable oil, salt, and black pepper.  

### 3. **Process to a Smooth Consistency**  
   - Blend or process the mixture until it forms a smooth paste. If the mixture is too thick, add additional water a tablespoon at a time to reach your desired consistency.  

### 4. **Taste and Adjust**  
   - Taste the green seasoning and adjust the salt, pepper, or vinegar/lime juice to suit your preferences.  

### 5. **Store the Green Seasoning**  
   - Transfer the green seasoning to a clean, airtight container or jar.  
   - Store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or freeze in small portions for longer storage.
