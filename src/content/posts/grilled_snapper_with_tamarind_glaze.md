**Prep Time:** 15 minutes (plus 30 minutes for marinating)  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Dietary Restrictions:** None  

## Ingredients

- 1 pound Pacific red snapper (whole or fillets, cleaned and scaled)  
- 1/4 cup tamarind sauce  
- 2 tablespoons oil (for grilling)  
- 2 cups mixed vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, zucchini, red onion, and cherry tomatoes)  

## Instructions

#### 1. **Prepare the Snapper**  
   - If using a whole snapper, make 2-3 diagonal slits on each side of the fish to help the marinade penetrate and ensure even cooking. If using fillets, ensure they are patted dry with a paper towel.  
   - Place the snapper in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag.  

### 2. **Marinate the Snapper**  
   - Pour the tamarind sauce over the fish, ensuring it is evenly coated. Use your hands or a spoon to work the sauce into the slits if using a whole fish.  
   - Cover the dish with plastic wrap or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. For deeper flavor, marinate for up to 2 hours.  

### 3. **Prepare the Vegetables**  
   - Wash and chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces.  
   - In a mixing bowl, toss the vegetables with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.  

### 4. **Preheat the Grill**  
   - Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat (approximately 375–400°F).  
   - Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.  

### 5. **Grill the Snapper**  
   - Remove the snapper from the marinade, allowing excess sauce to drip off. Reserve the marinade for basting.  
   - Place the snapper on the preheated grill. If using a whole fish, position it diagonally across the grates to make flipping easier.  
   - Grill the fish for 5-7 minutes on the first side. Brush the reserved marinade over the top for added flavor and moisture.  
   - Carefully flip the fish using a spatula or tongs and grill for another 5-7 minutes on the other side, basting again with the marinade. The fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork, and the internal temperature reaches 145°F (if using a thermometer).  

### 6. **Grill the Vegetables**  
   - While the fish is grilling, place the prepared vegetables directly on the grill or in a grill basket.  
   - Cook for 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the vegetables are charred and tender.  

### 7. **Serve**  
   - Transfer the grilled snapper to a serving platter. Arrange the charred vegetables around the fish.  
   - Garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley, and serve with additional tamarind sauce on the side, if desired.  

Enjoy the smoky, tangy flavors of this Guyanese-West Coast dish!
