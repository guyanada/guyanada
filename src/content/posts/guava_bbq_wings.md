## **Instructions**

### 1. Prepare the Chicken:
1. Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels.
2. In a large bowl, combine salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and green seasoning.
3. Toss the chicken wings in the spice mixture until evenly coated.
4. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight for more flavor.

### 2. Prepare the Guava BBQ Sauce:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine guava paste/jelly, ketchup, maple syrup, tamarind sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, grated ginger, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and allspice.
2. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the guava paste melts and the sauce is smooth.
3. Lower the heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.

### 3. Cook the Chicken Wings:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or prepare a grill for medium-high heat.
2. If using the oven, place the wings on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through.
3. If grilling, cook the wings for 8-10 minutes per side, until cooked through and slightly charred.

### 4. Glaze the Wings:
1. Brush the wings generously with the guava BBQ sauce.
2. If baking, return the wings to the oven and broil for 2-3 minutes until caramelized.
3. If grilling, brush with the sauce and grill for an additional 1-2 minutes per side.

### 5. Serve:
1. Arrange the wings on a platter, garnish with chopped cilantro or green onions if desired, and serve with extra guava BBQ sauce on the side.

## **Serving Suggestions**
Pair these wings with a light coleslaw or a tangy cucumber salad to balance the sweetness and heat. They also go well with cassava fries or poutine for a true Guyanese-Canadian fusion experience.
