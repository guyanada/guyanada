**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Yield:** Approximately 1 cup  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan, Gluten-Free  

## Ingredients  

- 10-12 wiri wiri peppers (or substitute with habanero peppers if wiri wiri peppers are unavailable)  
- 1/2 cup fresh lime juice (about 4-5 limes)  
- 1/4 cup white vinegar  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)  
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)  
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (optional, for smooth texture)  

## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Peppers**  
   - Rinse the peppers thoroughly and remove the stems.  
   - If you prefer a milder sauce, remove the seeds (use gloves to avoid skin irritation).  
   - If wiri wiri peppers are unavailable, use habanero peppers as a substitute for similar heat and flavor.  

### 2. **Blend the Ingredients**  
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the peppers, lime juice, vinegar, minced garlic, salt, and sugar (if using).  
   - Blend until smooth.  

### 3. **Adjust Consistency**  
   - If the sauce is too thick, add a bit more lime juice or vinegar to achieve your desired consistency.  
   - If using, add the vegetable oil and blend again for a smoother texture.  

### 4. **Taste and Adjust**  
   - Taste the sauce and adjust the salt, sugar, or lime juice as needed.  

### 5. **Store the Sauce**  
   - Transfer the sauce to a clean, airtight jar or bottle.  
   - Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.  

## Serving Suggestions  
This lime and wiri wiri (or habanero) pepper sauce is a bold and spicy condiment that pairs well with:  
- Grilled meats, seafood, or vegetables.  
- Fried snacks like plantain chips, pholourie, or aloo pies.  
- Rice dishes, curries, or soups for an extra kick.
