## Ingredients  

### For the Metemgee:

## Instructions  

### 1. **Make the Kelp Broth**  
1. In a medium pot, combine the kombu and 4 cups of water.  
2. Let the kombu soak for 5 minutes to soften.  
3. Place the pot over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil, as this can make the broth bitter).  
4. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, then remove the kombu. If desired, add soy sauce or tamari for extra flavor.  
5. Set aside 1/2 cup of the broth for the metemgee and refrigerate or freeze the rest for future use.

### 2. **Prepare the Cassava and Plantains**  
1. Peel the cassava and cut it into 2-3 inch chunks. Remove the tough core if visible.  
2. Peel the plantains and cut them into similar-sized chunks.

### 3. **Cook the Base Vegetables**  
1. In a large pot, combine the cassava, plantains, and diced butternut squash or Yukon Gold potatoes.  
2. Add the kelp broth and enough water to cover the ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the cassava and plantains are tender.

### 4. **Prepare the Coconut Base**  
1. While the base vegetables are cooking, mix the coconut milk, green seasoning, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Stir well.  
2. If using salmon, cut it into large chunks and season lightly with salt and pepper.  

---

### 5. **Combine and Infuse Flavors**  
1. Once the base vegetables are tender, drain most of the liquid, leaving about 1/2 cup in the pot.  
2. Pour the coconut milk mixture over the vegetables and stir gently to combine.  
3. Add the seasoned salmon (if using) to the pot. Cover and simmer over low heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the salmon to cook through and the flavors to meld.

### 6. **Finish and Serve**  
1. Taste the metemgee and adjust the salt as needed.  
2. Serve hot, garnished with fresh dill for a West Coast touch and lime wedges on the side for added brightness.

## Tips for Fusion  

- **Canadian Elements:** Incorporate regional ingredients like smoked salmon instead of fresh, or add a drizzle of maple syrup to the coconut milk for subtle sweetness.  
- **Seaweed Influence:** The kelp broth provides a briny, coastal depth of flavor, tying in the Pacific Northwest's seafood culture.  
- **Optional Vegan Version:** Replace salmon with roasted chanterelle mushrooms or smoked tofu to keep the dish vegan.
