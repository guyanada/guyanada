## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Risotto Base**  
1. Heat olive oil or butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  
2. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened and translucent.  
3. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute, being careful not to let it burn.  

### 2. **Cook the Risotto**  
1. Add the Arborio rice to the saucepan and stir to coat the grains in the oil, toasting them slightly for about 2 minutes.  
2. Pour in the sorrel drink and stir continuously until it is mostly absorbed by the rice.  
3. Begin adding the warm seafood or vegetable stock, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next ladle.  
4. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is creamy and tender but still has a slight bite.  

### 3. **Finish the Risotto**  
1. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the Parmesan cheese (if using), and season with salt and black pepper to taste.  
2. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.  

### 4. **Sear the Pink and Spiny Scallops**  
1. Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet over high heat.  
2. Season the scallops lightly with salt and black pepper.  
3. Place the scallops in the hot skillet and sear for 1-2 minutes on each side, until they develop a golden-brown crust. Pink and spiny scallops are smaller and more delicate, so be careful not to overcook them.  

### 5. **Assemble the Dish**  
1. Spoon the sorrel-infused risotto onto plates or bowls.  
2. Top each serving with 4-5 seared pink and spiny scallops.  
3. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley and a sprinkle of lime zest for added brightness.

## Notes  
- **Scallop Care:** Pink and spiny scallops are delicate and sweet. Searing them quickly at high heat ensures they remain tender and flavorful.  
- **Sorrel Flavor:** The sorrel drink adds a tangy, slightly floral note to the risotto. Adjust the amount to your taste preference.  
- **Pairing:** Serve with a crisp white wine, like Sauvignon Blanc, or a chilled glass of sorrel drink to complement the dish.  

Enjoy the delicate sweetness of pink and spiny scallops paired with the tangy richness of sorrel-infused risotto in this fusion masterpiece!
