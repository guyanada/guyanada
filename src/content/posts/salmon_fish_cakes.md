# Salmon Fish Cakes

**Cuisine:** Guyanese  

**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 4  
**Dietary Restrictions:** None  

## Ingredients

- 1 pound salmon (fresh or canned, drained if canned)  
- 1 large Yukon Gold or Russet potato, peeled and boiled  
- 1/2 onion, finely diced  
- 2 scallions, finely chopped  
- 1/2 teaspoon cilantro, finely chopped  
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme, finely chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed  
- 1 wiri wiri pepper, finely chopped (optional, adjust to taste)  
- 1 egg, beaten  
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (adjust as needed for consistency)  
- Vegetable oil for frying  

## Instructions

### 1. **Prepare the Salmon**
   - **If using fresh salmon:**  
     Rinse the salmon under cold water and place it in a pot with enough water to cover it. Bring the water to a gentle boil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork. Remove from the water, let cool slightly, and flake into small pieces, discarding any skin or bones.
   - **If using canned salmon:**  
     Drain the salmon and flake it into small pieces, removing any large bones or skin.  

### 2. **Prepare the Potato**
   - Peel the potato, cut it into chunks, and boil in salted water until fork-tender (about 15 minutes). Drain and mash the potato until smooth. Let it cool slightly.  

### 3. **Mix the Ingredients**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flaked salmon, mashed potato, onion, scallion, cilantro, thyme, crushed garlic, and wiri wiri pepper.  
   - Add the beaten egg and mix well to combine all the ingredients.  
   - Gradually add the flour, mixing until the mixture holds together but is not overly sticky. Adjust the flour quantity as needed.  

### 4. **Shape the Fish Cakes**
   - Divide the mixture into equal portions (about 8 small cakes or 4 larger ones).  
   - Shape each portion into a round, flat patty about 1/2 inch thick. Place on a plate or tray and set aside.  

### 5. **Fry the Fish Cakes**
   - Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan (about 1/4 inch deep).  
   - Once the oil is hot (test by dropping a small piece of the mixtureâ€”it should sizzle), carefully place the fish cakes into the pan. Do not overcrowd the pan.  
   - Fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Use a spatula to flip them gently.  
   - Remove the cooked fish cakes and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.  

### 6. **Serve**
   - Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce, such as tamarind chutney, hot sauce, or a simple lime wedge. These fish cakes pair well with a fresh salad or rice on the side.  

Enjoy these flavorful and herbaceous Guyanese-style salmon fish cakes!
