**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 10 minutes  
**Resting Time:** 24 hours (for steeping)  
**Yield:** Approximately 1 gallon  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan, Gluten-Free  

## Ingredients  

- 4 cups dried sorrel (hibiscus petals)  
- 12 cups water  
- 2-3 inches fresh ginger, grated  
- 2 cinnamon sticks  
- 5-6 cloves  
- 1-2 pieces dried orange peel (optional)  
- 1-2 cups sugar (adjust to taste)  
- 1/4 cup lime juice (optional, for added tang)  

## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Ingredients**  
   - Rinse the dried sorrel under cold water to remove any dust or debris.  
   - Wash and grate the ginger.  

### 2. **Boil the Water**  
   - In a large pot, bring 12 cups of water to a boil over high heat.  

### 3. **Add the Sorrel and Spices**  
   - Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed sorrel, grated ginger, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and dried orange peel (if using).  
   - Stir the mixture and let it boil for 5-7 minutes.  

### 4. **Steep the Sorrel**  
   - Turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid.  
   - Allow the sorrel mixture to steep for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours at room temperature. This enhances the flavor.  

### 5. **Strain the Liquid**  
   - After steeping, strain the sorrel mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean container to remove the solids.  

### 6. **Sweeten and Adjust Flavors**  
   - Stir in the sugar, starting with 1 cup, and adjust to your desired level of sweetness.  
   - If using, add the lime juice for a tangy kick.  

### 7. **Chill the Drink**  
   - Transfer the sorrel drink to a clean pitcher or bottles and refrigerate until cold.  

### 8. **Serve**  
   - Serve the sorrel drink over ice, garnished with a slice of lime or a cinnamon stick for presentation.  

## Tips  

- **Add Alcohol:** For a festive version, add a splash of rum or red wine before serving.  
- **Storage:** The sorrel drink can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.  
- **Variations:** Experiment with additional spices like star anise or nutmeg to customize the flavor.
