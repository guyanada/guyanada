**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 10 minutes  
**Yield:** Approximately 1 cup  
**Dietary Restrictions:** Vegan, Gluten-Free  

## Ingredients  

- 1/2 cup tamarind pulp (or tamarind concentrate)  
- 1/2 cup water  
- 1/4 cup brown sugar (adjust to taste)  
- 1/2 teaspoon salt  
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
- 1 clove garlic, minced  
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper or chili powder (optional, for heat)  
- 1 tablespoon lime juice  

## Instructions  

### 1. **Prepare the Tamarind Pulp**  
   - If using tamarind pulp: Soak it in the water for about 10 minutes to soften. Use your hands or a spoon to mash the pulp and separate it from the seeds and fibers. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to extract the smooth tamarind liquid.  
   - If using tamarind concentrate: Mix the concentrate with water to achieve a similar consistency.  

### 2. **Combine Ingredients**  
   - In a small saucepan, combine the tamarind liquid, brown sugar, salt, ground cumin, black pepper, minced garlic, and cayenne pepper (if using).  

### 3. **Simmer the Sauce**  
   - Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar and prevent sticking.  
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 5â€“7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.  

### 4. **Adjust Seasoning**  
   - Taste the sauce and adjust the sweetness, salt, or spice levels to your preference.  
   - Stir in the lime juice for a tangy finish.  

### 5. **Cool and Store**  
   - Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.  
   - Transfer to a clean jar or container with a lid.  
   - Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.  

## Serving Suggestions
